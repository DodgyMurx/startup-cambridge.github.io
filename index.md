## Computational resources

### For academics
The High Performance Computing cluster provides free resources for students. The resources do not have to be used for your direct academic purposes _but_ they are allocated on a "per PI" basis. The PI has no monetary cost but each PI's budget is limited to 8000 GPU hours per quarter.

### Generally available options (focus on Machine Learning)

* Amazon Web services (AWS)
* [Paperspace](https://www.paperspace.com/)

## Finding co-founders or additional team members
* Check out our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/hspfpFp)

## Entrepreneur events

* [EPOC events](https://www.epoc.group.cam.ac.uk/events)
* [Enterprise Tuesday](https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/entrepreneurship/programmes/enterprise-tuesday/)

## Graduate Entrepreneurs Visa
The University of Cambridge is an endorsing institution under the Home Office’s [Tier 1 (Graduate Entrepreneur)](https://www.gov.uk/tier-1-entrepreneur) route. An overview maintained by the university is available [here](https://www.internationalstudents.cam.ac.uk/tier-1-graduate-entrepreneur).


## Important advice

### Set up a contract between all founders / stakeholders

* Do not arrange profit share agreements. This is a red flag for investors you might want to get on board in the future.
* Arrange equity shares, ideally vetted (so that additional shares are only issued if stakeholders continue to contribute)

### SEIS and EIS scheme

* [EIS scheme (UK gov)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/venture-capital-schemes-apply-for-the-enterprise-investment-scheme)
  * The EIS scheme makes investing in your startup very attractive to investors. It can change the whole equation.
  * Furthermore, you can get tax benefits for your own R&D, such as an employed software developer.

### EU law

#### Data privacy

* Cookie rules
* Data privacy
* Newsletter opt-in

#### VAT rules

* Verification of country using a 2 out of 3 rule

##### MOSS VAT
If you sell product or services to customers, you generally have to collect VAT and then somehow transfer that money to the country where the customer is based. Now, that is impractical if you sell digitally and your customers can be anywhere in the world.
To automate that process, MOSS has been developed, the [VAT Mini One Stop Shop (MOSS)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/register-and-use-the-vat-mini-one-stop-shop).

## Checklist

### Thinking of a name

#### Finding a domain name
* [NameMesh](https://www.namemesh.com/)
* [Panabee](http://www.panabee.com/)

### Checking existing trademarks
* Do not ignore this step and do not start trading or spending money before you have checked your name against trademark registers.
* You can do the checks yourself for free:
  * [International trademark register](http://www.wipo.int/branddb/en/)
  * [European trademark register](https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch/#basic)
* Even just similar names can be problematic if customers can confuse brands.
